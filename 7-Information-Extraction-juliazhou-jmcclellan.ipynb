    "# Week 7 - Information Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we move from arbitrary textual classification to the use of computation and linguistic models to parse precise claims from documents. Rather than focusing on simply the *ideas* in a corpus, here we focus on understanding and extracting its precise *claims*. This process involves a sequential pipeline of classifying and structuring tokens from text, each of which generates potentially useful data for the content analyst. Steps in this process, which we examine in this notebook, include: 1) tagging words by their part of speech (POS) to reveal the linguistic role they play in the sentence (e.g., Verb, Noun, Adjective, etc.); 2) tagging words as named entities (NER) such as places or organizations; 3) structuring or \"parsing\" sentences into nested phrases that are local to, describe or depend on one another; and 4) extracting informational claims from those phrases, like the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) triples we extract here. While much of this can be done directly in the python package NLTK that we introduced in week 2, here we use NLTK bindings to the Stanford NLP group's open software, written in Java. Try typing a sentence into the online version [here]('http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/corenlp/') to get a sense of its potential. It is superior in performance to NLTK's implementations, but takes time to run, and so for these exercises we will parse and extract information for a very small text corpus. Of course, for final projects that draw on these tools, we encourage you to install the software on your own machines or shared servers at the university (RCC, SSRC) in order to perform these operations on much more text. \n",

       "\"I voted remain. I have just woken up to the Leave victory. My concern is that today the pound has dropped 13% in value. We have no other trade agreements outside of the EU, meaning we will likely still have to trade with the EU under EU regulations. We haven't lost dependence on the EU but we have lost our say in those events. Cameron (who I'm not a fan of) has stepped down, meaning we could potentially end up with the second unelected prime minister in my lifetime. I'm very worried right now and would appreciate some help to see the bright side of this, preferably about some issue other than immigration because I feel that the issue has been so inflated into fearmongering that it's not likely to feel reassuring.\\n\\nI've been researching the referendum for a while and my understanding of the subject is that a lot of people have chosen to vote leave because we were promised a) tighter immigration and b) money set aside for our priorities, e.g. the NHS. Immigration I don't think is being dealt with well since it's been presented as racism vs overidealism. The NHS funding promise was U-turned this morning within minutes of the results. It feels a little like the public have been misled, fearmongered and undereducated on the issue against their best interests.\\n\""

       "'>today the pound has dropped 13% in value.\\n\\nThe pound was already far more powerful than the Euro and the Dollar. That\\'s why you guys never adopted the Euro in the first place. So point one is that, even if it drops 13% you\\'re still a powerful economy, and it\\'s not as though your country can\\'t recover. Which leads me to point number 2. Money trading is just like the stock market. Investors are skittish, because they want to make investing (which is gambling) not _feel like_ gambling. So the slightest scare in their emotional hearts gets them to pull out of otherwise totally fine investments, like the British pound. What\\'s worse is that the smart investors notice the skittish ones and pull out, too, but only so they can buy back the stuff at the much lower price. It happens in every stock or currency market all over the world. However in the long run it\\'s just a blip where the stuff changes hands quickly and the long-run value stays on its normal course, which for England, is up.\\n\\n>meaning we will likely still have to trade with the EU under EU regulations.\\n\\nSure, but you\\'ll get to trade with the US, Russia, and literally every other country on earth according to your own rules. Moreover, it\\'s not like the EU will penalize your country for leaving: France, the Netherlands, and Germany have all considered it, too, and they\\'re the backbone of the whole thing. It\\'s not like you just declared war on them, you just didn\\'t want to be roommates anymore. They still have a lot to lose from not trading with the UK, but now you can trade with other people without their say so in your affairs.\\n\\n>Cameron (who I\\'m not a fan of) has stepped down, meaning we could potentially end up with the second unelected prime minister in my lifetime.\\n\\nSo? Cameron shouldn\\'t have been there in the first place if he was going to throw a hissy fit for not getting his way. \\n\\nThe main point is this: the EU was presented as a fairly low-commitment treaty between European nations. You get to have a trading block to collectively bargain against countries like the US. You get a single currency so you\\'re not going to have to mess around with Deutschmarks or Franks or Kroner or whatever other bullshit your neighbors call money, and you get a single passport so you can go to the country next to you without a visa or border guards or whatever other bullshit used to be there. It was presented as a petty bullshit minimizer, and people all over Europe bought into it, and rightly so. But that\\'s not what it turned into. It gradually became a rhetorical \"out\" for entrenched politicians to excuse their laziness in taking care of internal national issues. Now there\\'s a balance of political power (because money is always tied to power, and big trade agreements require both) residing in the hands of people associated with the trade block, not the people. It\\'s become a lumbering bureaucracy that can\\'t be held accountable to any national body: in essence a bullshit contributor. If at any point the bullshit added to your country\\'s life exceeds the bullshit solved by being in the EU, then the rational choice is to leave.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t to say that it was ultimately a good choice: self-determination is a risky endeavor. But it is enough to say that rational people can hold the opinion that leaving the EU is not a terrible unadulterated evil.'"

Conditional associations were a little more interesting, providing us with contexts of words of interest.\n",

Depth of phase trees could be averaged to get an idea of a comment's sentence complexity on average (complexity as judged by the parser, which is not perfect). Additionally, while parts of speech tagging enabled us to slice out contexts with more scalpel like precision, parsing enabled gave us a flexible level of precision in establishing contexts. The added abstraction of verb phrases and noun phrases, along with arbitrarily complex contexts, allowed us to see the verb and noun phrases that contained certain words of interest. The SubRelation fuction also allowed us to pick out certain parts of speech in V/N phrases also with arbitrarily complex contexts.\n",

    "    Dependency parsing, at least as shown in the parsing section, did not have as many uses independent of information extraction. Information extraction sat on top of dependency parsing, and took up a fair amount of time and memory. (Information extraction could not be run on my computer even with only 20 comments without running out of memory.) However, the highly interpretable subject/verb/object labelling might be useful if run over more data."
